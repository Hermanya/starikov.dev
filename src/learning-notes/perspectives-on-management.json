And you're going to be able to constantly promote talent, and constantly remove slackers [...] and you're going to send great signals to the market, and it's going to lead to wonderful results, what are you going to say? Well, I'll do that! [...] And if I don't tell you it's true, you won't be taking risks anymore, and your employees won't want to collaborate and they'll all hate you, are you then likely to adopt it? And the answer is yes. Because all you'll see are the positive outcomes that occur. And I suggest the reason why so many firms do it is essentially a network effect.",

      "quote": "So as the Roman Empire expands, what you find is their military costs also increase, and Rome was under a fixed gold standard, the only money available to the Roman economy was what they could dig out of the ground in gold and silver. So here you have a problem, on the one hand you have expanding military costs. At the same time you have essentially fixed money supply. What do you do? [...] Well the Romans couldn't print money because they didn't have printed money, they did the next best thing, which is they took a 100% gold coin, they added a little stuff in there, and they made it 90% and bang, they'd increased their money supply. [...] And so, what we find is that over the course of 50 years or so, there's a steady debasement of Roman coinage easily traced to the numismatics that we have still today.",

So there's all these experiences around you, this accumulated anecdotal evidence.
