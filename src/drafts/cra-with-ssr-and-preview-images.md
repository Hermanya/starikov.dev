You probably already knew that `create-react-app` is awesome. But I bet you did not know how much more awesome it really is thanks to [babel-plugin-macros][babel-plugin-macros] and all these build time super powers you have with macros such as `preval`. I hope this new knowledge comes in handy on your next React project!
