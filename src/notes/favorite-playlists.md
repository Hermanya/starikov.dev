# 6 Favorite playlists

These are the playlists that I listen most of often to.

## [Deus Ex human revolution](https://open.spotify.com/album/3t0h9Jw2lbQFCrBuDUMARd)

I haven't played this video game, because there is no mac port, but this is my go to playlist for programming.

## [Deus Ex mankind divided](https://open.spotify.com/album/6E3Bji2Z4yNO4LZQbJdoHI)

This video game I did play. The sound track is not as good as the other one, but the game is fantastic, and the music brings back good memories.

## [Cyberpunk 2077](https://open.spotify.com/album/1B2QrHbMox8vPXUY7rXAFp)

Another great video game. I got it on Google Stadia, very playbable. The soundtrack is sometimes too heavy for programming, but other times that's exactly what is needed.

## [Skate 2](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3gB8Y6NHOI0EubBGmQgP9L)

This is my go-to playlist for skateboarding. I used to play a lot of Skate 2 on xBox 360.

## [Skate 3](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7iMKDliotYnJUEjkfJ28Xg)

I find this soundtrack not as good, even though the video game is much better than Skate 2.

## [NBA 2k21](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1tsBJT5D8Y3tMZoO3f8EvE)

And this is my go-to playlist for basketball. I played a lot of 2k last year. I like to think that I learned something from it and it wasn't time wasted. This music will remind me of it.
