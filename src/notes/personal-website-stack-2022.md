# Personal website stack in 2022

_Published in May 2022_

1. [Sveltekit](https://svelte.dev/blog/sveltekit-beta) - static site generation
2. [hosted with Amplify on AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)
3. with Typescript, Eslint, and Prettier

Built on Svelte for minimal framework footprint, with code splitting through dynamic routes at build time.

For styling I'm using CSS variables with [color palette from iOS](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/#system-colors).
